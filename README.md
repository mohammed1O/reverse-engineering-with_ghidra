# reverse-engineering-with_ghidra
Overview
This project contains a detailed static and dynamic analysis of a Windows malware sample (artifact.exe) extracted from the uploaded artifact.zip. The analysis leverages several reverse engineering and malware investigation tools, including Ghidra, to uncover the sample's behavior, system interactions, and network activity
